"""Module for generating prompt templates for SIC classification tasks.

This module provides various prompt templates for tasks related to the classification
of respondent data into UK SIC (Standard Industry Classification) codes. The prompts
are designed to work with the LangChain library and include configurations for
different use cases, such as determining SIC codes, re-ranking SIC codes, and handling
ambiguous classifications.

The module includes:
- Core prompt templates for SIC classification tasks.
- Support for partial variables and format instructions.
- Integration with Pydantic models for structured output parsing.

Attributes:
    SIC_PROMPT_PYDANTIC (PromptTemplate): Template for determining SIC codes based on
        respondent data.
    SIC_PROMPT_RAG (PromptTemplate): Template for determining SIC codes with a relevant
        subset of SIC codes provided.
    SA_SIC_PROMPT_RAG (PromptTemplate): Template for determining a list of most likely
        SIC codes with confidence scores.
    GENERAL_PROMPT_RAG (PromptTemplate): Template for determining custom classification
        codes with a relevant subset of codes provided.
    SIC_PROMPT_UNAMBIGUOUS (PromptTemplate): Template for evaluating if a 5-digit SIC
        code can be assigned with high confidence.
    SIC_PROMPT_RERANKER (PromptTemplate): Template for re-ranking and selecting the most
        relevant SIC codes based on semantic similarity and business context alignment.

Analyze each candidate SIC code's relevance to the query.
Score each candidate on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 based on semantic similarity and
business context alignment.
Select the top N most relevant codes.
Provide clear reasoning for your scoring decisions.
Your response must be a single JSON object with NO additional text or formatting.

===Scoring Criteria===

Primary Activity Match (0.0-0.4):

Evaluates the fundamental alignment between the query and the code's main
business activity

Scoring guidelines:

0.35-0.4: Perfect match (e.g., "Beer brewery" → "Manufacture of beer")
0.25-0.34: Strong match with minor differences (e.g., "Craft brewery" →
"Manufacture of beer")
0.15-0.24: Related activity in same sector (e.g., "Beer distribution" →
"Manufacture of beer")
0.05-0.14: Tangentially related activity (e.g., "Beer tasting" →
"Manufacture of beer")
0.0-0.04: Minimal or no relation to primary activity


Context Precision (0.0-0.3):

Measures how specifically the code captures the business context of the query
Considers industry position (manufacturing, wholesale, retail, service)
Scoring guidelines:

0.25-0.3: Exact business context match (e.g., manufacturing vs. retail context)
0.15-0.24: Related context with same business model
0.05-0.14: Similar industry but different business model
0.0-0.04: Different business context entirely


Examples:

Query "Beer shop" matching "Retail sale of beverages" (high precision)
Query "Beer shop" matching "Wholesale of beverages" (medium precision)
Query "Beer shop" matching "Manufacture of beer" (low precision)


Example Activity Alignment (0.0-0.3):

Evaluates matches between query and specific example activities listed under the code
Considers both exact matches and semantic similarity

Scoring guidelines:

0.25-0.3: Direct match with example activities
0.15-0.24: Semantic equivalence to example activities
0.05-0.14: Partial overlap with example activities
0.0-0.04: No matching example activities


Special considerations:

Multiple matching examples increase score within range
Industry-specific terminology matches are weighted heavily
Generic matches receive lower scores

- Company's main activity: {industry_descr}
- Job Title: {job_title}
- Job Description: {job_description}
- Number of codes to select (N): {n}

===UK SIC 2007 candidates===

===Requirements===

Scores must be between 0.0 and 1.0
Selected codes must be exactly N in number
All codes must receive a score and reasoning
Reasoning must reference specific aspects of the code and query
Scores should reflect relative relevance between codes

You are tasked with assigning UK Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes to survey
responses with high confidence.

Key objective: You MUST assign a 5-digit SIC code from the candidates provided. Only provide a higher-level
code if multiple candidates have nearly identical confidence scores (within 0.2 of each other) AND no single
can be identified as the clear best match.

Assignment logic:
1. Default behavior: Assign the highest-confidence 5-digit SIC code from the candidates.
2. Higher-level code exception: Only if two or more codes have confidence scores within 0.2
 of each other AND you cannot determine a clear winner. Provide the most granular
higher-level code with X padding to 5-digits (e.g., 8610X for 4-digit confidence, 86XXX for
3-digit confidence, 8XXXX for 2-digit confidence).
3. 95% confidence interpretation: This means "more likely than not" given the available evidence -
not absolute certainty.

Key principles:
1. Focus on Best Fit: Rather than seeking absolute certainty, identify which code best fits the totality of evidence.
2. Prioritise information on employer of the respondent rather than their specific role.
3. Be Decisive: The goal is accurate classification, not perfect certainty. If evidence clearly points to one
code over others, assign it confidently.

Important: When a respondent's closed question answer directly matches or closely aligns with a SIC code
description, this constitutes strong evidence for that code.

Follow these steps in order:
1. Review all available information - respondent data, candidate SIC codes, and follow-up responses.
2. Evaluate each candidate SIC code against all available evidence.
3. Assign confidence scores - Rate each candidate from 0.1 (least likely) to 0.9 (most likely).
Weight respondent's own descriptions heavily.
4. Apply assignment logic - Select the candidate with the highest confidence score as your primary assignment.
Only consider higher-level coding if multiple candidates have nearly identical scores (within 0.2) and you cannot
differentiate between them.
5. Determine final assignment - Assign best fitting 5-digit code or the most specific higher-level code.
6. Provide clear reasoning - Explain your decision with specific evidence.

_open_follow_up = """"You are an expert survey methodologist specialising in
    UK industrial classification (UK SIC). Generate one open-ended follow-up question
    to help assign the most relevant UK SIC code.

Objective
- Produce exactly one question that elicits the key information needed to distinguish
    between the shortlisted SIC candidates, focusing on the employer's main business activity.

Inputs
- Respondent data:
- Company's main activity: {industry_descr}
- Job title: {job_title}
- Job description: {job_description}
- Shortlist from previous model: {llm_output}
- Note: These are candidate SIC categories; do not mention codes or "SIC" to the respondent.

How to decide what to ask
- Identify the smallest, most informative difference among the candidates and target that with a single question.
- Prioritise discriminators in this order:
1) Stage in the value chain (e.g., manufacture/processing vs wholesale vs retail vs repair/installation vs
    rental/leasing vs publishing/software vs consultancy/training).
2) Main product or service category (what goods/services the employer mainly provides).
3) Main customer type (households vs businesses vs government/health/education).
4) Delivery mode or setting (on-site vs online; physical goods vs digital; own-brand vs third-party).
- Ask about only one discriminator—the one most likely to resolve the ambiguity.

Quality standards
- Language and clarity:
    - Use plain British English; avoid or define jargon and abbreviations.
    - Keep the single question concise (max 25 words), grammatically correct, and neutral.
    - Use "employer" for for-profit; use "organisation" for non-profits, charities, public bodies, and education.
        Default to "employer", if ambiguous.
    - Refer to the present situation (e.g., "currently", "main").
    - Do not mention SIC or any code numbers.
    - Do not ask for company names, client names, or other personal/sensitive data.
- Question structure:
    - Start with "What", "How", "Which", or "Where".
    - Focus on the employer's main business activities, products, or services—not the respondent's personal tasks.
    - One issue per question; no A/B or either/or phrasing; avoid binary questions.
    - Limit to one sentence ending with a question mark.
    - You may add one additional sentence with broad, non-leading examples covering a wide range of options;
        omit examples if they would be leading.
- Respondent considerations:
    - Make it easy to answer in a few words.
    - Ask only what a typical employee would reasonably know.
    - Avoid requiring calculations or percentages.

Edge cases
- If the shortlist is empty or clearly points to one category, ask a general clarifying question about
    the main product/service or value-chain stage to confirm classification.
- Do not output explanations or reasoning; only the formatted result.

Output format
- Return output that strictly follows:
