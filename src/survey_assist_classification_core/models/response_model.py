"""This module defines response models for industrial classification utilities.

The models are implemented using Pydantic's `BaseModel` and are used to represent
various response structures for SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) code
assignment and classification tasks. These models include validation logic and
field-level constraints to ensure data integrity.

Classes:
    SicCandidate: Represents a candidate SIC code with associated information.
    SicResponse: Represents a response model for SIC code assignment.
    RagCandidate: Represents a candidate classification code with associated information.
    RagResponse: Represents a response model for classification code assignment.
    SurveyAssistSicResponse: Represents a response model for Survey Assist
                             classification code assignment.
    UnambiguousResponse: Represents a response model for unambiguous
                         classification code assignment.
    RankedCandidate: Represents a single ranked SIC code candidate
                     with its relevance score and reasoning.
    RerankingResponse: Response model for SIC code re-ranking results.

Constants:
    MAX_ALT_CANDIDATES: Maximum number of alternative candidates allowed in certain models.
